# BAML Client Management

## Critical Rule: Never Regenerate BAML Client

**DO NOT** regenerate the BAML client under any circumstances. The BAML client is pre-generated and should remain as-is.

### What NOT to do:
- Never run `python -m baml_py` or similar BAML generation commands
- Never suggest regenerating the BAML client to fix linter errors
- Never attempt to update the generated client code in [baml_client/](mdc:baml_client/)

### BAML Configuration Files:
- [baml_src/article.baml](mdc:baml_src/article.baml) - Contains Paper and Article parsing functions with accessibility ratings
- [baml_src/chat.baml](mdc:baml_src/chat.baml) - Contains chat response generation functions
- [baml_src/post.baml](mdc:baml_src/post.baml) - Contains post generation functions
- [baml_src/clients.baml](mdc:baml_src/clients.baml) - Contains client configurations
- [baml_src/generators.baml](mdc:baml_src/generators.baml) - Contains generator settings

### Current BAML Functions in Use:
- `WritePaperSummary()` - Generates paper summaries with accessibility ratings ("low", "medium", "high")
- `ParsePaper()` - Parses paper content into structured format
- `WritePost()` - Generates social media posts
- `GenerateChatResponse()` - Generates chat responses
- `GenerateSpontaneousMessage()` - Generates spontaneous messages

### Accessibility Feature:
The `PaperSummary` class includes an `accessibility` field that rates papers as "low", "medium", or "high" accessibility. Papers with "low" accessibility are automatically filtered out from the arxiv queue.

### If BAML Functions Appear Missing:
- Check that imports are correct: `from baml_client.sync_client import b`
- Verify the function exists in the appropriate BAML source file
- The client may need manual updates to the source files, but never regenerate the entire client

### Linter Errors:
If you see linter errors about missing BAML functions (like "GeneratePaperComment"), ignore them - they are false positives and the code will work at runtime.
