# Readability and Self-Documenting Code

## Human-First Readability
- Write code that is easy for humans to read and understand.
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes to convey intent without needing extra explanation.

## Self-Documenting Code
- Structure code so that its purpose and logic are apparent from the code itself.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity; prefer simple, direct solutions.

## Comments
- Use comments to explain the *purpose* of variables, functions, and complex logic, not just what the code does.
- Avoid redundant comments that restate obvious code.
- Place docstrings on all public functions, classes, and modules to describe their intent and usage.

## Example
```python
# Good:
def calculate_total(price, tax_rate):
    """Calculate the total price including tax."""
    return price + price * tax_rate

# Bad:
def ct(p, t):
    # Adds tax
    return p + p * t
```
